With over 15 years of experience as a Big Data Consultant and Solutions Architect, I provide strategic guidance to clients on optimizing their software infrastructures. I specialize in designing and implementing high-availability APIs and data architectures that align with fast-paced, large-scale data objectives, while maintaining a strong focus on cost efficiency. Additionally, I lead and mentor teams, driving performance improvements, enhancing observability, and ensuring the stability and continuity of projects and systems. My technical expertise spans Scala, Java, Rust, and data engineering, complemented by a deep proficiency in DevOps. I integrate tools such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Kafka, and Kinesis to deploy scalable cloud and on-prem systems and data pipelines.
